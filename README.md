# freetalk-webapp

This is a repo for the freetalk.fun MVP webapp. It will be built on the MERN stack with next.js for SEO.
<br>It is a media/blog app designed specifically for non-native English learners.
<br>The repo was made public, but is intended to share with friends and people I know in real life.
<br>If you're a stragner that sees this and loves it, you can reach me at: erondpowell@gmail.com
<br>Once the app is deployed to freetalk.fun, this repo will be made private.

**Key Features:**
 - **A unique blog** which has a youtube video at the head of every post and stores posts as snippets of content, which can be presented long-form (like a classic blog) or  delivered carousel-style and mixed with interactive content like quizzes/games/flashcards. (This hasn't been built yet, to get a rough idea of where it's going, checkout the courses sololearn.com)
 - **An ESL Dictionary** which delivers a basic google translation, then a long-version immersion English explanation. 
     <br>Initial explanations will come from a dictionary API like wiktionary, oxford, or wordsAPI (tbd) and get replaced by UGC definitions.
     <br>The dictionary will be available on a dedicated page, as a side-bar widget on blog posts, and a Chrome plugin for all websites.
     <br>Read about it in detail below at Resources>Freetalk Dictionary.
 - **Flashcards** which allow users to create 'decks' of flashcards.
     Cards can be created from-scratch.
     Cards can be created directly from dictionary entries.
     Users have ability to fully edit all explanations, example sentences, add hyperlinks, images and video clips.
     
This will serve as the MVP blog/learning app features.
<br>Forseeable future features are discussed in the Resources below, and will just extend these.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
