# freetalk-webapp

This is a repo for the freetalk.fun MVP webapp. It will be built on the MERN stack with next.js for SEO.
<br> It is a media/blog app designed specifically for non-native English learners.
<br>The repo was made public, but is intended to share with friends and people I know in real life.
<br>If you're a stragner that sees this and loves it, you can reach me at: erondpowell@gmail.com
<br>I'm learnign programming while building this, so please contribute any code that looks ghetto.
<br>Once the app is deployed to freetalk.fun, this repo will be made private.

**Key Features:**
 - **A unique blog** which has a youtube video at the head of every post and stores posts as snippets of content, which can be presented long-form (like a classic blog) or  delivered carousel-style and mixed with interactive content like quizzes/games/flashcards. (This hasn't been built yet, to get a rough idea of where it's going, checkout the courses sololearn.com)
 - **An ESL Dictionary** which delivers a basic google translation, then a long-version immersion English explanation. 
     <br>Initial explanations will come from a dictionary API like wiktionary, oxford, or wordsAPI (tbd) and get replaced by UGC definitions.
     <br>The dictionary will be available on a dedicated page, as a side-bar widget on blog posts, and a Chrome plugin for all websites.
     <br>Read about it in detail below at Resources>Freetalk Dictionary.
 - **Flashcards** which allow users to create 'decks' of flashcards.
     Cards can be created from-scratch.
     Cards can be created directly from dictionary entries.
     Users have ability to fully edit all explanations, example sentences, add hyperlinks, images and video clips.
     
This will serve as the MVP blog/learning app features.
<br>Forseeable future features are discussed in the Resources below, and will just extend these.
